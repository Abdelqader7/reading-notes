From this link: ### Mastering Markdown ### · [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

I've learned that Markdown is a syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

And how to use it to:

* Control the display of the document and format text
* Makes styled collaborative editing easy
* Apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

Also, there is an overview of Markdown syntax that we can use for the following:

Headers, Emphasis, Lists, Images, Links Blockquotes, and Inline code.

As an example of how easy it is:
** ** Using as opening and closing to make text Bold / * * to make it Italic.
the number of "#" represent the number of h like: # = h1, ## = h2, ### = h3 … ###### = h6

Whereas with GitHub Flavored Markdown: we can use it for the following:
Syntax highlighting, Task lists, Tables, SHA references, Issue references with a repository... etc.

 

From this link: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

I've learned that GitHub Pages lets you turn GitHub repositories into elegant websites to:

* Showcase your portfolio
* Showcase your projects, documentation or anything you want to share
* You don't need databases to setup or servers to configure
* It is most direct path to create websites for you and your projects
GitHub serves all of your projects sites from personal URL

you can upload your files and folders to it or drag and drop it.
Also of you want to built something like blog or structured documentation, GitHub pages gives you a streamlined publishing with the help of Jekyll that is an open source tool that transforms plain text files into websites, it is also support things like variables templates and drafts which give you over the format and presentation of your website.
